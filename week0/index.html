                    Why Omelette? Does it matter well cooked or not? Just because you're eating a fast breakfast or because it's delicious and rich food? Or dont you eat ??? Ok, i prepared this for everyone who eats omelette somehow. You can make it this way. Try and decide.

                  <h2>Why Omelette?</h2>
                  <ul>
                    <li><h3>Good Source Of Protein</h3>
                      This is the first health benefit. Most of us seldom get enough protein when we eat a carbohydrate-rich grain based meal. Therefore, it helps if you eat an egg based breakfast.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Keeps You Full</h3>
                      Carb-rich foods may fill you for one hour and may make you feel hungry soon. That might make you eat even more in your next meal. But when you eat a protein-rich meal, you tend to feel full for longer.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Other Nutriens</h3>
                      Many vegetables can be added to the omelet as fillings. This way, you can derive more nutrients in the form of vitamins and minerals.
                    </li>

                     <h2>Notes</h2>
                      <p class="comment">Did you realize that how mouch is butter? And there is no water in it. <br> Of course there are many different cooking techniques but this is my favorite. You should try at least once. <br> And i have a few suggestions for good contents.(if you eat omelette not only for feed, and also some pleasure and health)<br><strong class="bold">Best Choice for Eggs:</strong> Pastured eggs from a local farmer. Chickens live their entire lives outdoors, in the pasture, picking through cow dung, eating bugs and grass, basking in the sun.<br> <strong class="bold">Best Choice for Butter:</strong> Organic yellow butters from grass-fed cows. If you can find a local farmer it is the best. You can see cows, their place, their food and you can hear the story of your butter!<br><strong class="bold">Spatula:</strong> I offer a wooden spatula. It is for good result also the touch and sound feels good:) </p>
